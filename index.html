We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies on the Site to customize the Site and improve your experience. These technologies do not collect your personal information when you access the Site. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but you can remove or reject them if you choose. This may affect the availability and functionality of the Site. You cannot decline web beacons, but you can disable them by declining all cookies or modifying your browser settings to notify you each time a cookie is sent, allowing you to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis.
​
We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies on the Site to customize the Site and improve your experience. For more information on how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Policy, which is part of this Privacy Policy. By using the Site, you agree to be bound by our Cookie Policy.
​
Website Analytics
​
We may work with selected third-party vendors, such as Adobe Analytics, Clicktale, Clicky, Google Analytics,  and others, to allow tracking technologies and marketing services on the Site through the use of first party cookies and third-party cookies. These technologies help us analyze and track user behavior on the Site, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand online activity.

You are encouraged to review their privacy policies and contact them directly with any questions. We do not share personal information with these third-party vendors.

​
THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES
​
The Site may contain links to third-party websites and applications that are not affiliated with us, including advertisements and external services. Once you leave the Site through these links, the privacy policy of the third party will apply to any information you provide. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information when you visit these third-party websites.

​
SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
​
We have implemented administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. However, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are foolproof or impenetrable, and no data transmission method is completely secure against interception or misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information when it is disclosed online. If you have any concerns about the security of your personal information, you should not provide it to us.
​
POLICY FOR CHILDREN
​
We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.
​
CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
​
Many web browsers and some mobile operating systems offer a Do-Not-Track (DNT) feature or setting that allows you to signal your preference not to have your online browsing activity monitored and collected. There is currently no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals. As a result, we do not currently respond to DNT signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy to reflect our practices in response to DNT signals. If you set the DNT signal on your browser, we will respect your preference and not track your online activity.
​
